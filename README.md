# React My Books
This is a small scale application to manage your library of books. Your library consists of three shelves on which you can place your books: (1) Currently reading, (2) Books To Read, and (3) Completed Books. To add new books to your library, you can use the search feature and add them to any shelf. Once a book is in your library, you can move it from shelf to shelf, or remove it from your library entirely (simply hover over the book for options).


## Installation
1. To get started with this app, clone the repository:

  `git clone https://github.com/acurley31/react-my-books.git`

2. Navigate into the project directory and install all dependencies (i.e. react, react-router-dom, etc.)
  
  `cd react-my-books`
  
  `npm install` or `yarn install`

3. Once all the dependencies have been installed properly, start the development server:

  `npm start` or `yarn start`


## Notes and Usage
When you first launch the application, your library will be empty since none of the data is persisted. Similarly, the data will also be cleared out if you refresh the page.

The [Books API](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter/blob/master/src/BooksAPI.js) is provided by Udacity.
